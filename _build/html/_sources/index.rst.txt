Welcome to Coding with kids's!
==============================
Coding with kids can be a *great* way to not only teach them some skills 
that will help them with their own lives, but also *create or strengthen* 
some lasting **bonds between you and them.**

Throughout your journey you will both likely learn new ``concepts`` and ``terms`` 
that will expand your horizons and provide hours of enjoyment.

.. note::
   Some kids have problems with screen time and if you leave them unattended with 
   a screen and they hace access to things like Youtube or games, they may not stay
   focused on the task at hand.
